				<p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.</p>

		<h1>Study sheds light on human consumption of microplastics</h1>
		<p>A study from the University of Victoria has for the first time compiled research on microplastics to try to estimate just how much people are consuming.</p>
		<p>Microplastics are pieces of plastic that are just under five millimetres in diameter — or smaller than the size of a sesame seed — that come from the degradation of larger plastic products or the shedding of particles from water bottles, plastic packaging and synthetic clothes.</p>
		<p>Garth Covernton, a PhD candidate at University of Victoria's department of biology, said his team looked at 26 papers assessing the amount of microplastics found in individual food items.

The study found that a person's average microplastic consumption — based on those food items previously analyzed — would likely fall between 70,000 and 121,000 particles per year. While younger girls were at the lower end of the spectrum, adult men were at the high end.

People who consume a lot of bottled water could see that number jump by up to 100,000 particles per year.

The study analyzed the amount of microplastics found in fish, shellfish, sugars, salts, alcohol, water and air, which account for 15 per cent of Americans' caloric intake.

But the other 85 per cent of what people consume, like beef, poultry, dairy and grains, has still not been examined.

		<p>Most studies on plastics have focused on the oceans.

Peter Ross, president of Research Ocean Wise, said there are two main effects that have been observed in sea life: structural toxicity, when plastic literally blocks the gills or the stomach of a fish, convincing the animal that it's full and causing it to starve to death; and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals that can have other effects on the body.

"A lot of plastics have hardening agents like BPA or they have phthalates, or they have flame retardants in them," he said.

"So if humans or other species are exposed to these, that's cause for concern from a toxicological standpoint."

Covernton said his team is now calling for more research to understand just how much a lifetime of exposure to microplastics will affect human health.

"The biggest issue with these particles is they don't seem to really go away — if anything they'll probably just increase in concentration over time because plastic unfortunately doesn't break down in the environment over a human lifetime," he said.

"It may seem overwhelming but I think that there are solutions if we deem it to be a problem — we just need to come together to get there," said Covernton.</p>
